# Changelog

What changed in each Holm release, newest first. Holm shows a version's
section in its "What's new" dialog, so each entry is written for the people
using it. Headings are `## <version> — <date>`. One line per change:
**New:**, **Improved:** or **Fixed:**, then a plain line of at most about
twelve words, ending with a link to its PR.
